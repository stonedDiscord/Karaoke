These are some notes for my DAM XG-1000 Karaoke machine

There's:
- a script to unlock telnet access
- some IR codes i recorded
- a tool to modify the font data, to render romaji on top of the font
- a web downloader for clubdam so i have my own DB of compatible songs that's easier to search through
